Along with rehabilitation our goal at Blue Moon Raptors is to share the important roll they have in our ecosystem to help maintain the balance of nature with educational programs. We discuss what we can do to make a difference to preserve the environment so raptors may continue to enrich our planet. In doing such programs we hope to educate, and promote the protection of wildlife and our environment for future generations."
